# Issue tracker: specs/ (local Spec Kit + Wayfinder)

Issues, specs (PRDs), and Wayfinder maps for sctxx live as markdown under `specs/`. GitHub Issues are an
optional promotion surface, not the default store: sctxx is built by several coding agents, some without
`gh` auth, and the checkout must stay usable offline.

## Conventions

- One **feature block** per directory: `specs/<NNN-slug>/`, where the slug starts with its roadmap
  milestone (`m0-`, `m1-`, …).
- Spec Kit artifacts in that directory:
  - `spec.md` — feature specification (`/speckit-specify`, also a Matt Pocock PRD)
  - `plan.md` — technical plan (`/speckit-plan`)
  - `tasks.md` — ordered implementation tasks (`/speckit-tasks`)
  - `research.md` — facts the plan waits on
  - `evidence/T###.md` — per-task proof
- Do **not** collapse implementation tickets into one mega file once a block is being built. If
  `/to-tickets` runs, write `specs/<NNN-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`.
- Triage state is a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md`).
- Comments append under a `## Comments` heading.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create or update a file under `specs/<NNN-slug>/`. Prefer `spec.md` for a full PRD.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the referenced path. The user normally passes the path or the `NNN-slug` / issue number.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is a file with one child file per ticket.

- **Map**: `specs/000-wayfinding/map.md` — Destination / Notes / Decisions so far / Not yet specified /
  Out of scope.
- **Child ticket**: `specs/000-wayfinding/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`. Body holds
  `## Question`. Header lines:
  - `Type: research | prototype | grilling | task`
  - `Status: open | claimed | resolved`
  - `Blocked by: [ticket title](relative/path.md)` (optional; never a bare ID)
- **Blocking**: a ticket is unblocked when every file listed in `Blocked by` is `Status: resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `specs/000-wayfinding/issues/` for files that are not `resolved`, have no unresolved
  blockers, and are not `claimed`. Lowest number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save **before** any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under `## Answer`, set `Status: resolved`, then append a one-line gist +
  relative link to the map's Decisions so far.

## GitHub promotion (optional)

If a ticket later needs a GitHub issue, create it with `gh` and record the URL on the local file. Do not
make GitHub the only copy.
